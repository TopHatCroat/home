### Search directory for string with regex
-h : don't output file name

-P : perl-style Regex

-o : print only what matches pattern

First group is a zero-length look behind to find some kind of anchor before the actual text to find.

Ex. ...code=ASDF.1234 -> prints only ASDF.1234

    grep -hoP "(?<=code=)\w+\.\w+" *
