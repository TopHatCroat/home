### Quickly run Docker container and attach to shell
`docker run -i -t --entrypoint /bin/bash <imageID>`

### Delete all containers and images
`docker rm -vf $(docker ps -a -q)`

### Delete all images
`docker rmi -f $(docker images -a -q)`

### Run with basic output (the sane one) which is usefull for debugging images
`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 docker build .`

Afterwards you can jump into this image to see what's going on
`docker run --rm -it [img id] bash`
